Conventions:
1. In matrix notation, rows iterate over time, columns iterate over agents. So Pmin[1,5] is time 1 agent 5
2. Index for an agent is denoted by "i", index for time is "t", index for node is "n", for pipe is "p"
3. Power injection by an agent or node is POSITIVE when it is a net generator.
